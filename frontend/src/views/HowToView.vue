            RoboRush is a multiplayer coding challenge about finding a path from A to B for a robot on a 2 dimensional map. The game is played in a turn-based
            manner, so that every player's robot moves at the exact same time.
          </div>
          <div>
            Each player controls their robot via REST interfaces to check its environment. They also triggers all available robot actions. Since the robots are
            not aware of the map around them, they might need to have a clever way to navigate through the map. But be careful, because all actions will deplete
            the robot's fuel tank a little. If a robot runs out of fuel, it becomes immobile and can't perform any movement actions.
          </div>
          <div>
            To win the game, your robot must be <span class="highlighted">the first to reach the target position</span>. Each win adds one point to your entry
            on the high score list.

            Every player has exactly one robot, which possesses various attributes. The robot's name is taken from the player's username and can be instructed
            via a REST interface. To visually watch the live attributes, visit the main page and ensure you are logged in.

            Each robot starts a new game with a full fuel tank. The amount of the fuel tank can be different for each map. Rest assured, we made sure that you
            have a good chance of reaching the target tile. Most robot actions will drain the fuel tank. When it
            <span class="highlighted">reaches zero fuel units, your robot will not be able to perform any action that requires fuel</span>.

            A robot can be instructed via a REST interface, which requires your API access token. We provide an
            <a href="/api/swagger-ui?urls.primaryName=public" target="_blank">OpenApi Spec for the robot</a> as an overview of all available commands and the
            authentication. To send example requests, use your API token in the "Authorize" button dialog at the top. The "Try it out" button will then use it
            in all following requests.

          <div>
            With this action the robot moves to one of the neighbor map tiles. The robot can only move one tile at once in one of the 4 directions (east, south,
            west, north). Every movement costs the height difference of the map tiles plus 1 static fuel. "Rolling down" from a higher tile to a lower one,
            costs only 1 fuel unit in total. After the movement the robot state is updated via the robot status interface. There, the <code>lastResult</code>
            attribute will contain the new position.

            With the scan the robot will retrieve the map tiles around it according to the given scan distance. The scan returns every tile which has a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry" target="_blank">Manhattan geometry</a> equal or less then the given distance. A scan is
            very fuel-consuming on large patches, since the cost is the distance squared. The results are available on the robot status endpoint after the
            execution phase. Like on the movement action via the <code>lastResult</code> attribute.

            If the map allows it, the robot can spend a turn and charge its fuel tank to gain some fuel units. This amount is a small percentage of the fuel
            tank capacity. Typically below 5%. It is intended to be a emergency backup if a robot is stuck by mistake.

            The map serves as the playground where every robot will move. It is described by tiles arranged in a grid with variable size. Before the start of
            the next game, the map can be switched, depending on the preferences of the operators. However, during a game, the map size remains constant.

            Every tile position is described by a two-dimensional coordinate system with x and y. The origin tile with <code>(0,0)</code> iis in the top left
            corner and x increases towards the right and y to the bottom. As a example the robots in the map above are at position <code>(2,3)</code> and
            <code>(5,7)</code>.

          <div class="doc-title">How the robot sees the map</div>
          <div>
            The map on the main webpage shows all tiles which where seen by any robot. A single robot sees way less than that. Robots start without any
            knowledge of the surrounding tiles. They can only see some tiles and their attributes around their current position. To retrieve more information
            about further neighbor tiles, it requires a scan action.
          </div>
          <div>
            To see the known tiles of your robot use the personal "My Robot" page. There, only tiles which where visited or scanned by your robot are shown.

          <div class="doc-title">Tile attributes</div>
          <div>
            Every tile has a height, which is displayed in different shades of green on the web UI. Higher tiles are brighter than tiles at zero level. Robots
            can move on all tiles with a height in the range of 0 to 255 (including both). Some tiles are marked with colored borders. For more information on
            these tiles, see the special tiles section.

            tile, which must be reached to win the current game. Its position can be retrieved from the global game information. The position is usually

            RoboRush is a pure turn-based game to ensure that all actions happen simultaneously. For this purpose, the game engine has defined game states.
            Those describe exactly what is currently happening. In the Overview below, you can see all possible state transitions. This includes also
            transitions with timeouts (indicated by little clock icons). Timeouts simply pause the game flow for a defined time in the current game state. To
            get a feeling for those timeouts, they are available on the game information endpoint. (See the
            <a href="/api/swagger-ui?urls.primaryName=public" target="_blank">OpenApi Spec</a>).
          </div>
          <div class="doc-img">
            <ImageComponent
              class="m-3 is-block is-background-grey"
              image-src="/img/how-to/game-states.drawio.svg"
              title="The game states with all possible transitions."
            />
          </div>
          <div class="doc-title">PREPARE</div>
          <div>This state selects one of the available maps and prepares everything for a new game.</div>
          <div class="doc-title">WAIT_FOR_PLAYERS</div>
          <div>
            During this phase the game allows the registration of new robots for the upcoming game. New participants will be spawned immediately at a random
            start tile of the map. In case of no players after the timeout, the game will reset to the preparation state.
          </div>
          <div class="doc-title">WAIT_FOR_ACTION</div>
          <div>
            While the game is in this state, every robot can schedule its next action. This is typically done by making decisions based on the current game and
            robot information. If an invalid action is intended, the server return errors with a description. Also if a action with a return value is scheduled,
            the data will be available <span class="highlighted">after</span> the action state.
          </div>
          <div class="doc-title">ACTION</div>
          <div>
            Now all robot actions are executed and all action results stored in the robot attributes. After the execution the target tile will be checked for a
            standing robot. If no winner is found, the state transitions to <code>WAIT_FOR_ACTION</code>. Otherwise the winner will be announced and the game
            will enter the ending phase.
          </div>
          <div class="doc-title">ENDED</div>
          <div>
            The final state acts like a cooldown period. During that no robot interaction is possible. Also the winning robot is displayed on the web UI as well
            as in the game info endpoint. After this cooldown phase, a new game starts by transitioning to the <code>PREPARE</code> state again.
